# IoT-to-Everything
The main project’s goal was to design user-friendly Android application, small and cheap electronic device and to provide communication between them. The device should cost less than 2 euro and control bigger systems, like a water irrigation system. The aim of application is to allow user to communicate to the device, giving him different instructions, like a initial configuration or a alarm configuration, and receive data from the device, like sensors or status information. There is opportunity to choose device by its localization. From each of them, user can get information about temperature and humidity and also choose date and time to set the alarm. The device is composed of a micro-controller and a series of sensors that interact with a smartphone connected to the Internet. The objective of this product is to connect an offline system to the cloud, where the data will be stored. The communications between the device and the smartphone will be made by image using a device’s LED and smartphone’s flash and camera, and sound using device’s microphone and the smartphone’s speakers respectively.
